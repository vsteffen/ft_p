# ft_p
42 School project done with [@magouin](https://github.com/magouin). From the subject (also available in french):

> This project is about creating a client and a FTP server (File Transfer Protocol) that allows you to send and receive files between one or many clients and the server.
>
> You are however free to choose the protocol you will use (you are not obligated to respect the RFC defining FTP, you can invent your own protocol of file transfers.) No matter your choice, you must however absolutely obtain a coherence between your client and your server. They must communicate properly with each other.
>
> The communication between the server and the client will be in TCP/IP (v4).
